How are projects managed?

# Traditional(Waterfall) vs Agile workflow

## Waterfall - A specific deadline (Finals)

- Each piece is worked on one at a time to launch the project all at once V1 - V2
- Prone to roadblocks
- More solid intial planning
- Can be harder to split tasks

### Example
Client
- Create a government website
- This is going to take 1 year
- Cost - $100k

3 months into this and down 25k
Client reaches out and says you know what, can we add this feature?

-  Planning -> Database -> Backend -> Frontend -> Release

Cons
- Harder for modifications in the long run

## Agile - Existing products/apps

- Iterative approach
- Dynamic
- Designed to deliver a product in smaller, faster stages / sprints V1 - V1.1 -V1.2 etc
- It is very Scrum compatible
- Individuals/interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Cons
- More team interaction -> prone to broken telephone

# SCRUM -> Maintain consistancy with Agile project management
