Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. - Dwight D. Eisenhower

# How useful is planning for our projects?
- Very crucial, if not the most important aspect of our project.
- Backtracking

Prevents hefty modifications to your database, backend, frontend.

# Can we create a project without a plan? 

Exhausting
Navbar
    - height
    - color
    - popout
    - appear on the top, left, or right side of the app

Descision fatigue

# Scope -> The end goal of my app. What do I want my app to accomplish

Solid vision for your app and half way through you come up with another feature.

# Techstack

- Backend
    - Rails
    - Express


- Database
    - SQL
    - Another way to save videos

- Frontend
    - React
    - Rails
    - template engine

Other tech
- Vue.js
- Nextjs
- Chrome extensions -> React Native
- SwiftUI -> iOS apps
- Android Dev Studio -> Android apps
- React Native/Flutter -> iOS and Android apps
- Crypto Currency -> Larry Coin

-> Learning these tech stacks will take away from development time

# User Stories will help us understand what our tech needs are.

- Youtube Clone -> MeCylinder video watching platform

As a user...

As a user I want to be able to upload videos
As a user I want to be able to watch videos
As a user I want to be able to comment on videos
As a user I want to be able to like a video
As a user I want to be able to favourite a video
As a user I want to be able to create a playlist

<!-- Stretch goal -->
As a user I want to be able to live stream
As a user I want to be able to watch videos offline


Features that we want our users to have in our app.

Divide which feature will be a part of the MVP - Minimal Viable Product
Stretch -> Something that we can integrate at a later time, or after the initial release

Do we want this app to be online or offline?

How much time do we have? 

- A month?
- A year?


Major features, always establish this first
- What type of app is this for? Mobile? Web? Android or iPhone?
- Online or offline?
- Will we have a community?

Do some research

2. Database/Flow

3. ERD
4. Routes (web app)
    -  /login - GET AND POST
    - /logout - POST
    - /register - GET AND POST
    - etc.

5. Wireframes(Figma, sketch.io, AdobeXD) - reduces decision fatigue -> figure out the placement of components now instead of later
    - Components, and how everything fits together
        - HTML structure
    - Mobile or website view
    - Flow of the app
6. Setup the Project structure(Establish our tech stack), and the naming conventions(Style-Guide)
    - Should we go with what we know? Or try something new? A new tech stack
    Something new?
    Learn something new, put yourself ahead of everyone else
    A new tech stack, takes away time from development

    Example:
    1 month
    - Planning - 1 week, Database - 1 week, Backend - 3 days, Frontend - 1 week and 4 days(for bugs)
    
    Something we know?
    Build it faster, fewer problems

    - Front end React? Backend Rails?
        Lookup on how to set it up
        Boilerplates
    - MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
    - Research about different tech stacks, and find different boilerplates
7. Setup Github Repo
8. Workflow and Tasks (Trello, Asana, Jira, Github)
9. Communication (Slack, Email, Discord, etc.)

- Weekly meetups (Scrums)
    - This is what I did the week prior, the day prior, or the previous sprint
    - This is the roadblocks I faced, and this is what I currently need help with
- Sprint - a length or period of time given to work on a given task
