# Five rules of Success
    - Ask for help
    - Put in the hours
    - Take breaks and get proper sleep (Avoid coding at late hours)
    - Don't compare yourself to others
    - Be comfortable going out of your comfort zone

# Plans are worthless, but planning is everything - Dwight D. Eisenhower

During your development process, you may find yourself having to stop coding and make decisions along the way.  
    - "What color and size should this button be?"
    - "How big should my nav bar be?"
    - "Should these items in a list stack vertically or horizontally?"

Having a well thought out and established plan will help with your development process by avoiding decision fatigue. This way you can focus on coding, and refer to your design/wireframes that you made ahead of time.

Much like in real life, sometimes unforseen circumstances will appear along your development process. At this point, you can revisit your plan and adjust it.

Even if you don't stick with the original plan, it is still ideal to avoid decision fatigue and be prepared for the journey ahead.

# Don't start with Code

Here are some things to have before you start coding:

- An idea
- User stories
- Resources
- ERD
- Routes
- Wireframes

# Set Personal Goals

You'll be working on a massive project, which in itself, is a goal. You can also take this time to establish some personal goals.

Here are some goals you can aim for:

- Boosting your technical/non-technical weaknesses
- Getting the full-stack experience
- Understanding the entire project codebase

# Previous Projects

# After the Bootcamp

You can always expand or enhance your portfolio. This can be done by expanding on existing projects like your midterm or final project, or creating new projects from scratch.

From there you can learn about hosting and publish them to make it accesible to recruiters/employers who are reviewing your application. They won't spend time looking at your Github repository and going through the code themselves.

## Revisit Compass

You will have Compass available to you to brush up on your foundation. You can also dive in and finish the stretch activities.

## Expand your knowledge or learn a new skill

## Look into certifications

Depeding on the field you want to get into, a certification can help you. Please keep in mind that some certifications may not be tailored for the field you want to dive into, so do some research first and see which ones will benefit you. Others will help your expand your knowledge.
