Client Side rendering vs Server Side rendering?

Projects SSR? -> Data, fetchs, are all done via the server
EJS -> TinyApp

CSR -> Tweeter -> The users machine

Client being the user's device-> Their smartphone, their computer, etc.

Server side rendering -> Another computer

Downsides to CSR?

- It all relies on the user's machine

XMLHttpRequest -> XHR
fetch

jQuery.ajax()
axios
