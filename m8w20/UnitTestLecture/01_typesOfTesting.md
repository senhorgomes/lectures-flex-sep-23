# What are some types of testing that we have covered?

- Unit Tests (TDD) -> One part/function -> A helper function that validates emails/password
    - Happy Path
    - Sad Path

- Integration Testing -> How one part fits with the rest of the code. 



- Regression Testing -> Version changes
- End-to-End - testing the app like a user(we will learn this in the next lecture)
- manual -  the dev is running the code
