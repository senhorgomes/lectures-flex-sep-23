Brainstorm ideas

# What makes a good project?
Its not just the idea, but the implementation of an idea.
There have been several iterations of a single idea. If we take a look at Google, it was a search engine like the rest. But it was how they approached searching that really made them stand out by using their own algorithm and crawlers.

## Can we make a clone of an existing app?

Of course.

# Coming up with ideas

## Make something that stands out from the crowd

Really focus on one feature if needed

## Make something that solves a problem you have

Most companies came out from solving problems that the founders experienced themselves

Look at your interests, passions, day-to-day or work life

## Make something that you want to use

It doesn't have to be something you need to use in real life, people have built interfaces for video games before


# There are good ideas and better ideas

# Elevator pitches

They will be 1 minute each

- Introduce your app
    - App name
    - Tagline
- Explain what your app does
- What makes your project unique/stand out? Give an example of a feature

# How to be successful with creating your project?

Which libraries for certain features?
